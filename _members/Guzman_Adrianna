About me:
Hello! Im from South Carolina. I am attending Trident Technical College in north Charleston to major in horiticulture beginning fall 2023. I began working at Clemson's Pee Dee Research and Education Center in summer 2022 for Dr. Juang Horng (JC) Chong's ornamental entomology lab where I aided research on aphid and white fly pest management of ornamental crops like Poinsettia and Coleus. 

In the Rife lab I facilitate phenomic research including testing our 3D printed hardware and troubleshooting methodology of new projects. I am currently learning the basics of 3D design in Tinkercad and Fusion 360 and horticultural techniques for greenhouse and controlled climate growing.
